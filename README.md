Mod for Factorio: screensaver using LTN mod.

Press CTRL+S in-game to start the screensaver.

Screensavers looks for new deliveries, and glues camera to the train untill the delivery ends (train returned to depot).

Press CTRL+S again to return to normal game.

WARNING: very lazy programming. The game will probably crash in mulriplayer. The game may crash if the player is killed during the screensaver stage and you turn the screensaver off. The game will probably crash if the train being followed is destroyed.

UPD: Multiplayer should be fine, killing the player or train being followed should be fine.
